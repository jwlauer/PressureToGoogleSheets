Overview
============

This repository includes code for developing a wifi-enabled differential pressure logger using an ESP32 microcontroller (Lolin D32 Pro), a MS5803-05 pressure sensor, a BMP/BME 280 atmospheric pressure 
sensor, and an optional DS3231 Real Time Clock. 

The logging program saves data to an SD card or flash memory and 
attempts to post the data to a Google Sheet using a Google Apps Script (which must be set up separately).
